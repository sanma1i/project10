Creating a client for existing school database REST API using REACT. The full stack application will provide a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retriving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating and deleting courses in the database. In addition, the project will require users to create an account and sign in to make changes to the database.
